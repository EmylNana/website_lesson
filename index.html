			<h2>Motivation</h2>
			<p>I was interested in computers since i was 10 years old, everything started from gaming, later I was interested in computer parts and PC building. At 14 years old I started making first my own project of Video game Minecraft, later i made Lineage2 and Rust Video games servers with communities. I realized that the creation is my passion and I dive in to it more. I went to courses of ELECTRONIC PUBLISHING and C++ Proogramming. I know exacly that i have passion for computers and making projects,  thats why i started studying in HZ University ICT. I'm motivated to learn about IT more and build up IT Solutions company. I hope to get more experience about IT and be more fluent at communication</p>

			<h2>Information and Communication Technology</h2>
			<strong>Binge watching a series on Netflix, use WhatsApp or listening to Spotify? This is all possible thanks to IT!</strong>

			<h3>Making developments possible</h3>
			<p>We live in a connected world in which physical objects are massively linked to the internet. Think of a security camera that sends a message to your smartphone when a person walks through your garden. Or AI (artificial intelligence), where a self-learning algorithm learns whether it is safe to cross a street. IT is the field that makes these developments possible and creates them.</p>

			<h3>Discover which direction suits you best: technical or business</h3>
			<p>IT often involves programming and system management. But it is so much more than that. Brainstorming about a good software solution for a customer, coming up with a cloud solution, building a new application, collecting and interpreting data to advise a company or tackling cyber security. The possibilities are endless. Whether you want to develop in the direction of the business side or the technical side. In the course of your studies we will help you to discover which direction suits you best and we teach you everything about the latest technologies and trends.</p>

			<h3>Working in multidisciplinary teams</h3>
			<p>In addition to developing your own skills, you will often work in multidisciplinary teams. We do this in an agile way. This means not working according to just one described perfect approach. It does mean meeting your customer demand and being able to solve his/her problem in a fast, flexible and creative way together with your team. In precisely the same way as when you join the job market. You not only consider your projects, but also your own development as a professional.</p>

				<h2>Year 1</h2>

				<p>You are introduced to the world of IT. You will learn an important skill for solving problems in IT: programming. Just like the corporate world, we use the agile methodology. This means that you evaluate both yourself and your project during biweekly sprints. At the end of year 1, you will be able to develop software in different programming languages. In the first year you focus on the following themes:</p>
				
				<h3>Computer Science</h3>
				<p>Computer Science is the science that describes how a computer works. You will learn about the history and fundamentals of computer science and how to apply this in practice in your own software. We teach you the basics of programming, taking your level into account.</p>
				<h3>Game development</h3>
				<p>In this block you will learn everything about object-oriented programming while developing a game yourself. You work on your programming knowledge, and in the final weeks you will together with your team develop an educational game for primary school children.</p>
				<h3>Modern Software Development</h3>
				<p>In order to quickly and securely develop applications such as mobile apps, games or web applications, frameworks like Unity, Java Play and Laravel are used frequently. You are introduced to development within the Laravel framework. You are introduced to the basic functions of the framework, such as MVC, routes and migrations. You directly apply your knowledge in practice by carrying out a project for an external client.</p>

				<h2>Year 2</h2>

				<p>Will you come up with an IT solution that suits the needs of your client? This year is dedicated to your own work environment and your client. You frequently work on assignments for real companies in project groups. You use the agile methodology: during biweekly sprints, you evaluate your project, yourself, and your role within your team. You do not only work on your knowledge, but also on your development as a professional. You focus on the following themes:</p>

				<h3>Business value creation</h3>
				<p>During this semester your central focus is on the user. You can do this through Design Thinking, a process in which you focus on the user, work in teams, and which allows you to find creative and innovative solutions for your ICT issue. We also work on Continuous Integration. Looking at how to create value for your company and your client is an important theme during this semester.</p>
				<h3>Data Science</h3>
				<p>You work on machine learning, cloud computing and data visualisation. You learn how to determine which requirements an application has to fulfil. During this semester, you will also investigate whether you are interested in entrepreneurship and think about ethics in your field.</p>
